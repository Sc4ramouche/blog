    <main><h1>We are not writing enough software</h1>
<p>Writing random software is essential, as is starting new projects, even if you abandon them.</p>
<p>I believe it is fair to say that the work we are paid for mostly orbits around long-lived software. When we spend some time with a long-lived piece of software, we get a rough idea how it works and how it is delivered. However, if the system is big enough, working with it can often feel like navigating within many constraints. For most of the changes we intend, we have to account for a heavy context that is inherent to complex systems.</p>
<p>We get used to this environment of constraints. One can even forget how jolly it is to sail the seas with the tailwind supporting you in whatever direction you go. And starting a new random software project has the power to remind us of the joy it can bring.</p>
<p>Surely, there's a line where systems get big enough and complex enough, the tailwind dwindles and it starts to look like same-old. It's fine. We can spend some extra mental effort to grapple with the system, to see if there are tradeoffs to make and simplicity to embrace, winning some tailwind back. But all in all, it's fine if the software you created gets abandoned for whatever reason. If you got to feel the excitement of working on a software project, that's a win. If the software you built proved useful for you or someone else, that's a big win. </p>
<p>And I don't think it is possible to start a random software project and not learn something new. Especially if you started a project in a programming language you are excited about, but do not have the opportunity to explore at work. But it doesn't always have to be something new to try for you to learn from a random software project. Even if you work with familiar tech, you might obtain a new perspective on a particular problem or domain. Such moments of reflection can affect how we think about software and contribute to our engineering esteem.</p>
<p>I believe we should try to maintain the momentum and write software almost on a whim. It doesn't always have to be spontaneous; perhaps an appealing and exciting project will go further than an after-lunch idea, it's up to you to decide how much planning you are willing to exert. The key is to occasionally allow oneself to break free from numerous constraints and explore ideas that we have been stacking on the back shelf. We forget how rewarding it can be.</p></main>
