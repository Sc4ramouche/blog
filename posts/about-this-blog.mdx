So I've decided to start a blog. There are three main goals I want to achieve with this:

1. Create an organized record of what I've learned and refer to it when necessary;
2. Improve writing skills;
3. Increase public visibility.

I find a great benefit in taking notes when I learn new stuff. Maybe, "benefit" is a wrong way to put it, because I can't even recall what I've learned in 4-5 months, thus making notes is essential part of the process for me. Having said that, I intent to increase retention with short articles in this blog, trying to express some concepts for my future self. Maybe it would even be helpful for someone else besides me, who knows (it would definetely be cool)!

To be honest, for a long time I didn't think of writing as an important skill in life and career. After all, most of us can produce sentences and express their thoughts, right? Not really. At some point, I realized that writing is an art form, and when I find myself immersed in the text â€“ it is the result of a well-thought and careful author's craft. With this blog, I hope to improve my own ability to express thoughts and ideas with text.

Another thing I realized recently is the importance of the "network". I've heard some great stories when it was not the competence that played a crucial role in someone's next big move, but the connections they made during their career. There's a great potential that might be hidden within one's network, and with this blog I hope to make more connections with other people in the world.
