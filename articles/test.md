Writing random software is **essential**, as is starting new projects, even if you abandon them.

Here's an example with **bold text *with* italic in it**.

And some * italic text with **bold focus** inside*.

Simple text *with* italic

Throwing in a [link node](https://github.com) mix.

Can a **bold link [exist](github.com) in this** world?

Weird statement with a random in it.

- what about a list?
- can we **successfully** support it?
  - nested list item
  - really advanced now
    - third level
    - going really deep
- back to the basic level

I hope we can.
